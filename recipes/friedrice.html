    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried rice is a personal favorite of mine, and this recipe is one that I use often when I am hungry and want something easy to make.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breast</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Chile Flakes</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Seasame Oil</li>
            <li>Minced Garlic</li>
            <li>Frozen Veggies</li>
            <li>Preffered Rice</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice chicken and place in a mixing pot, add seasonings (except sugar), minced garlic, soy sauce, and seasame oil and let it marinate for about 15-30 min.</li>
            <li>Start rice and steam veggies while the meat marinates (I have a 2-in-1 rice cooker and steamer so it saves time).</li>
            <li>Cook chicken on medium heat for about 6-8 minutes</li>
            <li>Once rice and veggies are finished add to pot</li>
